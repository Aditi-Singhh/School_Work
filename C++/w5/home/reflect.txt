Workshop 5: Member Operator Overloads- AT_HOME REFLECTION, June14, 2018
          

Reflection: 

1. The operator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should not return a reference to a Fraction object.
Because we create a temperate object in the function and copy the value from current object if condition meet to return copied value. 
The lifetime of the fraction object is only inside this function. When function ends, it will be end or will go out of scope. 
Thus, if we return reference of this fraction object after execution, the reference that points to the object will be broken since the lifetime ends.

2. List the temporary objects in the tester module.
(a+b), (b+d)

3. List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize duplication.
I used isEmpty() function multiple times in other member functions to simplifty the process of checking empty state. Besides, I applied +operator in +=operator function defination to reduce code redundancy in addition as well as using ==operator in !=operator defination.

4. Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
I learned how to define and declare operators in class as the member functions and got to know how to access the current object within the operator function.
Besides, by referencing objects to operator functions, I learned how operator function works and the way to reduce code redundancy with reuse of operators in same class.
Lastly, I learned the difference between returning copy and returning reference, and emphasized how to write code based on different return type.
