Workshop 8: Virtual Function - AT_HOME REFLECTION, July19, 2018
          

Reflection: 

1. What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?
The abstract base class defines interface but don't provide implementation, while the concrete class is derived from base class that implements and gives a specific meaning to the interface.
The abstract class inherits at least one pure virtual function and identifies the class hierarchy which is the gateway to test the derived class.
And because there is no implementation from the abstract class, the compiler cannot instantiate the class. 

2. Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?
In the ChequingAccount class, the debit() and credit() functions shadow functions of the same name in the Account base class.

3. Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
I have learned how to define the pure virtual functions and understood the difference between the abstract class and the concrete class.
I practiced how to use the interface and code the derived class from the abstract base class.
Lastly, in the debugging step, I learned how debit() and credit() functions in the ChequingAccount shawdow functions of the same name in the Account class, where I have to use Account:: to clarify.
All the above helps me to understand the meaning of virtual functions and the relationship between classes.
