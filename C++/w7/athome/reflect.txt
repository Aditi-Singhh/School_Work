Workshop 7: Derived Class - AT_HOME REFLECTION, July15, 2018
          

Reflection: 

1. Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the SuperHero class? (Hint: do a search in Hero.cpp, does the word SuperHero?appear anywhere?)
No.The Hero class doesn't include word SuperHero because the base class doesn't need to know about the derived class.

2. Does the SuperHero class need to know about the existence of the Hero class? (Hint: do a search in SuperHero.cpp, does the word Hero?appear anywhere?)
Yes. The SuperHero class need to know about the existence of Hero class because it is derived and inherited from Hero base class.

3. The program prints out "Ancient Battle!"ù when 2 Heroes fight. It prints out "Super Fight!"ù when 2 SuperHeroes fight. When you tried to make a Hero fight a SuperHero, what did it print out?
The output will be "Ancient battle!" Because when we assign Hero and SuperHero by reference, the function will be called based on static type which is Hero class. So it will use the Hero operater* and output "Ancient battle!".

4. True or False: are the following definitions for main valid?
int main() { Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5); }
True.

how about this? int main() { (Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5)) * (Hero("Atalanta", 10, 3) * Hero("Hippolyta", 10, 2)); }
True.

QUIZ 6 REFLECTION:
Question3, What is shadowing in the context of a derived class? My defination is not quite there.
Corrected answer:
Derived class shadows member functions in the base class based on the same identifier not on their signature.
