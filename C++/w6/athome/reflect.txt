Workshop 6: Class with a Resource- AT_HOME REFLECTION, July8, 2018
          

Reflection: 

1) Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else?
It is necessary to check when we want to do deep copying for our object which contains raw pointers.
Since the logic of copy assignment operator is to deallocate pointer in *this, reallocate new memory, and copy from the assigned object to *this, if we don't check, deleting pointer in current object may also deallocate the assigned object for the self-assignment case. 
Without self-assignment check, the program may result in unpredictable behavior.

2) List how you avoided duplication of code.
I avoid duplication by applying isEmpty() function in other member function coding. Also, I use copy assignment operator to reduce code in overloaded += operator function.
Lastly, we can use constructors inside other functions to reduce the code redundancy and make the code much clear.

3) List what you have learned in completing this workshop.
I have learned the differences between copy constructor and copy assignment operator in deep copying.
Also, I practiced with avoiding duplication in coding by using special member functions, such as isEmpty() and copy assignment operator.
All these clarify my knowledge about class and resource, shallow copying, and deep copying, as well as differences between constructors and operators.
